# BLAST_genes_and_count_haplotypes
First version of the code in matlab that blasts a target sequence to several strains. 
The blasted sequences are combined with previous FASTA files and entered in an output file called 'sequence_table.mat"

sequence_table.mat contains all the sequences in a cell array
The variable "nm_all" has the names of the strains in the cell array sequence table.

SNP_finder_DNA finds the haplotype clusters for all the strains.
